## **03_machine_learning.ipynb** ü§ñ 
Recent Notebook. I created a machine learning model based on a house price competition.   
In **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product) I wanted to show how my project works, so I chose **Linear Regression** model, which is a simple ML algorithm. In the next weeks, I want to create more models and test them on the collected data. The cost function is MAE (Mean Absolute Error), because I think it is the best solution for this project.
