## **Prepare-Data.ipynb** ‚öôÔ∏è
In this notebook, I downloaded data from justjoin.it api and clear them. I wanted to create my project only using offers in Poland, so I removed all offers from aboard. [GO TO NOTEBOOK ‚û°Ô∏è](https://github.com/MalarzDawid/my-ai-path/blob/main/notebooks/Prepare-Data.ipynb)

## **EDA.ipynb**  üìà
Based on previously created data, I created basic analysis about salary, most popular technologies, cities and other features. For this example I used **pandas**, **seaborn** and **matplotlib** for visualization. [GO TO NOTEBOOK ‚û°Ô∏è](https://github.com/MalarzDawid/my-ai-path/blob/main/notebooks/EDA.ipynb)

## **Machine-Learning.ipynb** ü§ñ 
Recent Notebook. I created a machine learning model based on a house price competition.   
In **MVP** (Minimum Variable Product) I wanted to show how my project works, so I chose **Linear Regression** model, which is a simple ML algorithm. In the next weeks, I want to create more models and test them on the collected data. The cost function is MAE (Mean Absolute Error), because I think it is the best solution for this project.
